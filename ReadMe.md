# Azure DevOps Gantt

**Azure DevOps Gantt (A-DOG)** is a tool used to generate a [Mermaid JS](https://mermaid.js.org/) [Gantt Diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gantt.html) from an Azure DevOps Feature work item and its child work items.

## How to Use

This guide assumes that you already have access to an Azure DevOps organization, project and work items and are able to create Personal Access Tokens with a _Work Items (Read)_ scope. If you do not and would like to still use the tool, you can setup a free Azure DevOps [Organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization), [Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project) and [Work Items](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/view-add-work-items) using the linked docs.

1. Create a dependency hierarchy using the Azure DevOps Related Work Links, placing the dependency link type on child work items. By default the dependency link type is _Tests_ but is configurable in the tool. If you are unsure of how to assign work item links, please see the [Azure DevOps Work Item Links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/add-link#link-a-work-item-to-another-work-item) doc. See also the [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section _Dependency Relation_ setting for an example.
1. Create a new Personal Access Token with a _Work Items (Read)_ scope. If you do not know how to create a Personal Access Token, please see the [Azure DevOps Create a PAT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate#create-a-pat) doc.
1. Navigate to this repository's [GitHub Pages](https://onyxnox.github.io/AzureDevOpsGantt/).
1. If you have never visited the tool, the _Control Panel_ will be automatically opened, enter the context details and update any default settings to fit your Azure DevOps environment.
1. Click on the _Generate_ button at the bottom of the _Control Panel_.

        <td>
            Azure DevOps work item relationship (link) type that identifies the parent work item.
            <br />
            <b>Example:</b> If we have <i>WorkItemA</i> and <i>WorkItemB</i>, and <i>WorkItemB</i>
            depends on <i>WorkItemA</i> to be completed first; we would expect the dependency link
            type of <i>Tests</i> to be placed on <i>WorkItemB</i>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Section Tag Prefix</b></td>
        <td>
            Azure DevOps work item tag prefix that identifies the work item's domain and the section
            it is listed under. If no section is specified <i>Default</i> is assigned.
            <br />
            <b>Example:</b> A section tag prefix of <i>Section:</i> with a work item tag of
            <i>Section:Configuration</i> would result in the work item being listed under the
            <i>Configuration</i> section.

## Q&A

### 1. How are work items scheduled on the gantt diagram?

Work items are scheduled based on the dependency hierarchy and sorted by priority ascending then by
effort descending. Parallel task execution is restricted by the defined _Resource Count_.

## To Dos

1. [ ] Allow user to create resource blockers that identify no progress will be made on assigned work items.
1. [ ] Allow user to enable an automatic refresh so that the diagram is updated as the Azure DevOps Feature is being updated.
1. [ ] Allow user to have multiple saved configurations (Context + Settings).
1. [ ] Add an information panel on the right side of the viewport to show additional details, such as the diagram's raw text, selected work item's raw response, etc.
1. [ ] Allow user to change the tool's primary color as well as the gantt diagram's colors.
1. [ ] Update diagram's work item node colors based on their current status.
1. [ ] Allow the user to time travel using the [`asOf` query Parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax#query-language-overview) ([1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-items/get-work-item)) to show historical snapshots of work items.
1. [ ] Expanding on the entry above, allow the gantt diagram to account for work items running over their estimated effort.

## Developer Notes
